# Arduino-TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe game based on an LED Matrix, some buttons and an Arduino Uno

##Key
All the pins in the code are referred to as either **DX** or **AX**, whereas the **D** marks a **digital** pin and the **A** an **analog** one.
The **X** after the D/A mark the number of the Pin.

Players are referred to as **PX**. The **X** is replaced by either a **1** or a **2**, indicating which player is being referenced.

##Components
The components utilized in this project are **9** green LEDs with **2,9V** - **3,5V** @ **20mA** with a corresponding **470Î©** resistor and **3** generic buttons.

A 5V USB Power-Source is used.

##Assignations
The LED Pins are assigned as shown in the table.
The value on the **left** defines the Pin on the arduino and the value on the **right** specifies the position in the LEDPins[] array.
